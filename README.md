# Surf Finder

A ML approach to find new surf spots on the world. The general idea is to find Coasts with Waves that have potential to be a surf spot. Perhaps we can find some hidden gems :).

## To do
- ~~Find coordinates of surf spots~~
- Scrape satelite images
    - ~~surf spots~~
    - non surf spots
- Pre-process images
- Select good example images for FewShot Learning Model
- Train model

## Possible extensions
- Use swell maps
- Use Coral maps
